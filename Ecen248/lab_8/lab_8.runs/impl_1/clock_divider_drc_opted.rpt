BIVB-1#1 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:67
Bank 67 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported for banks of type High Performance.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
ClkIn
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-58#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets ClkIn_IBUF_inst/O] >

	ClkIn_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in ClkIn_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to K17
	ClkIn_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) cannot be placed

	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Clock Rule: rule_bufgce_bufg_conflict
	Status: PASS
	Rule Description: Only one of the 2 available sites (BUFGCE or BUFGCE_DIV/BUFGCTRL) in a pair can be
	used at the same time
	ClkIn_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.O) cannot be placed


Related violations: <none>

PLHDIO-5#1 Error
HDIO DRC Checks  
The following IO terminals need to be placed in HIGH_DENSITY IO banks (based on their IO standards), but they are incorrectly locked to non-HIGH_DENSITY IO banks. Please review and update the LOC constraints:
ClkIn

Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
4 out of 5 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: ClkOut[3:0].
